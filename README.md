# DevWeekend's Data Structures Course 
Some **considerations** while starting with problem-solving till 100+ Leetcode problems are solved:

- Start with the most-easiest problems.
- DO NOT try to solve each problem yourself, instead try to learn and understand how different problems are being solved
- Do not try to solve a problem for more than 1 hour initially to get fast and to achieve more in less time, for any problem taking more than 1 hour, put it in a backlog and solve it later
- Average time to solve a problem should be 30-45 minutes
- Do not try to solve a lot of problems from one topic, instead try to solve 5-10 problems per topic
- Do not try to jump into problem-solving directly without the necessary pre-requisites, For example
  > If you are trying to solve a problem that requires HashSet/HashMap then make sure you have studied HashMap before solving the problem
  > If you are trying to solve a problem that uses recursion, first make sure you learn recursion properly
  > If you are trying to solve a problem that uses graphs/trees, first make sure you learn graphs/trees properly
  > If you are trying to solve a problem that uses dynamic programming, first make sure you learn dynamic programming properly.

- Stl for C++ Programmers (It will help to speed up the coding part using built-in functions and short hands)
- Note: The given lecture has Data structures like set and hashmap which we haven't studied yet, don't worry we will be having a dedicated lecture on them for now just have a high-level idea.
